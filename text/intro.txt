``$`` ./welcome```

I'm an undergraduate at Stanford University, class of '18. I have a passion for tinkering, designing, and programming. One of my biggest interests is the intersection of design and mobile. If I don't have homework for whatever reason, you'll likely find me tinkering with the theme on my jailbroken phone, shooting arrows with my bow, or playing ping pong.`

I used to create and sell themes for jailbroken iPhones, was a software intern at Cyanogen, and am currently working at Stanford's High Performance Computing Center. I'm currently seeking summer software internship opportunities.```
