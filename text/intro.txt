I'm a recent grad from Stanford University, class of '18. I have a passion for tinkering, designing, and programming. One of my biggest interests is the intersection software and social good. If I'm not working on a personal project for whatever reason, you'll likely find me playing competitive overwatch, trying to capture the perfect photo, or out riding my bike.`

I used to create and sell themes for jailbroken iPhones via <a class="c" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cydia" target="_blank">Cydia</a>, created automated mobile phone theming solutions at <a class="c" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyanogenMod" target="_blank">Cyanogen</a>, worked at Stanford's <a class="c" href="https://hpcc.stanford.edu" target="_blank">High Performance Computing Center</a>, and am currently working on a platform for increasing accessibility of affordable solar power in developing countries at <a class="c" href="http://www.angaza.com" target="_blank">Angaza</a>.```
